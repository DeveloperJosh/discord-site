# discord-website
This repo is created to align the developers that work on the discord-website.

In the root you can find:
*this readme file;
*css, fonts, js and images folder which contain respectively style sheets, fonts, images and javascript scripts used by the pages;
*the three pages used: 
    *index.html, the entry of the site,
    *mobile.html and desktop.html, the pages that show the tutorial based on the device you want to use;
*.git folder and .gitignore file used to respectively sync this repo and ignore useless files;
* all the other files needed to show the site icon (and the icon of any mobile connections on any device, andorid, ios, windows phone). They have not been grouped in a folder because it is not recommended.
